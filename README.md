# Magus
Magus Gui wizzard

Magus is a Qt application that generates C++ code for GUI applications and offers a set of standard widgets to quickly create an application. 

![Magus overview](Master.png)

Magus generates a c++ project, based on a template (.ide file). The template can be modified in the application. Currently only Qt projects are supported.
The application comes with a set of icons (512x512) specific for 3D type of applications. It is possible to use your own icons.
In addition, Magus comes with a set of extra widgets to support fast development.

Note, the Git repo also contains some Windows Dll's. These are VC2010 Qt Dll's. Their purpose is more as a reference (to show which Dll's are needed for the executable).
